# GameBundl front end 

This is the front end repository for GameBundl.

GameBundl is a demo application built with ReactJS and Spring and hosted on Azure. 

The application implements a concept idea of a digital game sales platform that allows for customers to build custom video games bundles. By adding your first game to a bundle, you'll be able to see other games you can add with it to get an overall discount on all the games in your bundle, and how much that discount is. As a user, I can view my saved bundles, and build new ones. 

This application was built as a training exercise to gain familiarirty with React, the Spring framework, and Cloud hosting
